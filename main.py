Green Bite is an API that __attempts__ to calculate sustainability scores for food. Sometimes it even works! 🤷‍♂️

## How is it calculated? 💡
`(amount * land_usage) + (amount * greenhouse_gas_emissions) = sustainability_score`

## Based on what data? 🤓

* The [SHARP database](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919309722). Environmental impacts of 40,000 foods commonly eaten in 40 countries.
* Simple weight tables to convert between volumetric and mass measurements.

## What's the catch? 🤨
The API makes __a lot__ of assumptions and simplifications. Take the results with a grain of salt.

* GHGE and Land usage are the only metrics used, and they are weighted equally.
* False positives are to be expected. The RegEx / NLP used to find matches is very basic.
  * Use the `/parse` endpoint to inspect the details and make your own judgement.
* Many ingredients are not in the database (or not in the format one might expect them to be).
